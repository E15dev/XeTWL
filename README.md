# XeTWL
library for graphics in linux terminal, i will use it in my other projects.

for now its in alpha stage i need to do a lot of stuff

# setup
run `./build.sh`, it will create library and copy it to `/usr/local/lib/xe/`, it will also copy headers to `/usr/local/include/xe/`

# usage
if you use g++, add `-L/usr/local/lib/xe/ -lxetw` on end
